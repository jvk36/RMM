TestArrays.cpp

Covers Creation of one region and allocation of one array within that region.

TestMultipleArrays.cpp

Creates 2 regions and allocates an array into each region independantly.  The first region is freed, the second is not and then the cycle loops.
This is to test region independance.  As well, since the second region was not freed, it tests to see if allocating into that second region will
keep the first allocated memory in there or overwrite it.

TestMultipleObjects.cpp

Similar to the previous test, this allocates two regions and pushes 5 random numbers into both of them independantly. 
In this case they are both freed, to test that they can be freed individually.

TestNestedRegions.cpp

This test allocates a region of 10mb and then allocates within it another region of 1 mb.  This test ensures that
this can be done safely.  As well, different equations are computed with their results being stored in the nested region to show that it does not affect the 
larger region, but does affect the smaller region.  As well, deallocation is preformed on the nested region to show that it does not affect the larger retion. 

TestObjects.cpp

This test allocates a region and add things to it.  It then frees its region.  It repeats multiple times to ensure that it can be repeated and it is
not a one time deletion.
